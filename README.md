# 🚦 Traffic Sign Classification using CNN

This project is a deep learning-based Traffic Sign Classification system implemented in Python using Keras and TensorFlow. It leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to accurately classify traffic signs into 43 different categories, making it suitable for autonomous driving applications, educational demonstrations, or as a base for further research.

- **Total Images:** Over 50,000 labeled images
- **Classes:** 43 traffic sign classes

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic-sign-classification.git
cd traffic-sign-classification
````

### 2. Install Requirements

You can use Anaconda or pip to create the environment.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Basic required libraries:

```txt
tensorflow
keras
numpy
matplotlib
pandas
scikit-learn
opencv-python
```

### 3. Run the Notebook

Launch Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment:

```bash
jupyter notebook "traffic sign classification final.ipynb"
```

Ensure the `dataset/` directory (with proper structure) is in the same folder.

## 🧪 Example Prediction

After training, you can upload a custom traffic sign image and use the model to predict the class. The image is resized to 30x30 and passed to the trained model.

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

* **Accuracy**
* **Loss**
* **Confusion Matrix**
* **Precision / Recall (optional)**

## 📷 Visualization

The notebook includes plots for:

* Training vs Validation Accuracy
* Training vs Validation Loss

## ✅ Future Improvements

* Use data augmentation for better generalization
* Apply Transfer Learning using pre-trained CNNs (e.g., MobileNet, ResNet)
* Create a web app or Android app for real-time classification
* Add bounding box detection before classification
